	One missing null test addressed.

	M    XDStructure.cc

2011-12-02  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed the rpm target - the .spec file had an extra directory
	listed in it.

	M    conf/libtool.m4
	M    xml_data_handler.spec

2011-12-02  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	rationalized the XMLWriter.h includes give its move into libdap.

2011-12-02  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixes for the distcheck target. Variables like $abs_top_srcdir
	work fine for 'check' but not for 'distcheck' because with
	distcheck they have a '../' in them and when a path like that is
	passed to the BES, it reports an error. The way around this is to
	use readlink -f on the value of that variable and substitute the
	result. One wrinkle on this is that OSX lacks a working version of
	readlink. See configure.ac for the work-around.

2011-11-23  Nathan Potter <ndp@coas.oregonstate.edu>

	xml_data_handler: Fixed type in spec file

2011-11-22  Nathan Potter <ndp@coas.oregonstate.edu>

	xml_data_handler: Created an (empty) OSX_Resources dir so that
	make distcheck wouldn't barf on the fact it wasn't there.

2011-10-23  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Modified configure so that this code builds only the so version of
	the library by default. Changed the copyrights so they are
	correct. Fixed tests.

2011-10-14  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed XMLWriter in favor of the copy now in libdap; fixed unit
	tests accordingly.

2011-10-03  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed a regression test that was using old options for the netcdf
	handler

	M    tests/baselines/coads_climatology.nc.xml_data

2011-09-26  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Minor updates to the Makefile and libtool.m4

2011-09-26  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Tried to banish the warning about linking against a loadable so,
	but without luck.

2011-09-26  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed the unit tests - they were using some uninitialized
	variables that, therefore, had random values.

2011-09-21  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Hyrax 1.8

	Ignore .bescmd files in here

2010-08-10  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	more test baselines...

2010-08-10  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed lingering issues with xmlWriter API. Two problems: In some cases, start_xml_element() was called with element == "" and the xmlWriter function will not create an element like that! Odd that xmlGetLastError() did not return an error object... Second issue: One call to xmlWriterStartElement did not include the test < 0 so if the function returned 0 it was treated as an error. Oddly, it seems that the function often was returning a positive value often, so this condition didn't trigger an exception until several calls into making the document.

	Made sure xml_data response added to dap service and description
	correct.
	M    BESXDModule.cc

	Minor fixes for eclipse 3.6's autotools syntax stuff

2010-08-04  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

2010-08-04  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	More tests... This version works for all types.

2010-08-04  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

2010-08-04  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Works; Grid projection to Structure bug fixed.

2010-08-04  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Ignore a bunch of files (WRT svn)

2010-08-04  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Regression tests - first version. There's a problem with Grids projected to Structures

2010-08-03  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	unit-test fixes; header fixes and new code for Sequences.

2010-08-03  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed the float64 from the structure test because it was breaking things with a changing value - values depend on calling order and frequency.

2010-08-02  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed old code; added boilerplate versions of methods for Sequences.

2010-08-02  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Tests now use external files

2010-08-02  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Multi-dimensional arrays now have the information about dimensions 0 ... N-1 in enclosing <dim> elements. Consolodated the vector case to a single function.

2010-08-02  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	This version handles complex arrays without crashing.

2010-07-30  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added support for 'complex' arrays - arrays of structures. Testing structure arrays that contain arrays themselves is not working...

2010-07-30  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed problem with arrays. Now works for all types except Sequences and arrays of structures. Array printing still has hold-over code from the asciival days.

2010-07-29  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Not quite working...

2010-07-28  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed stuff that's automatically generated - got added by import's over zealous algorithm

2010-07-28  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added

	A    .
